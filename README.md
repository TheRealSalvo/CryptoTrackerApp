#  CryptoTracker

Fun project to experiment with api calls on swift and some apple frameworks.  


## Setup
You can clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/TheRealSalvo/CryptoTrackerApp.git```  

You should use a demo api key from CoinGecko, you can obtain one for free following this [guide](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/21880397454233).  

Create a Config file in XCode and paste the following line ```API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>```, replacing <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE> with your actual api key
